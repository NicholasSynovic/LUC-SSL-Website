## Hello World

**We are in the process of migrating our web site.**
If for any reason you are looking for something, please see [the Old SSL web site](https://loyolachicagocs.github.io/ssl/).

Thank you for checking out the Software and Systems Laboratory (SSL) website. We are a (mostly virtual) research laboratory based in the [Computer Science Department at Loyola University Chicago](https://www.luc.edu/cs).

Our [members](/team) form an interdisciplinary group with [faculty and student interests](/projects) in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Information Technology, Cyber Security, and Engineering.

The laboratory’s focus is on researching computer systems and applied Software Engineering to solve STEAM-related problems.

## Methodology

We foster innovation by encouraging experimentation and collaboration with a strong emphasis on openness. To uphold this commitment, we enforce [open-source software development](https://github.com/SoftwareSystemsLaboratory), open access, and dissemination of research software by creating reproducible results within all of our projects.

SSL embraces the notion that diversity drives creativity and innovation. We follow the principles of the [IEEE Special Technical Community on Broadening Participation](http://stcbp.org/) allowing anyone regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, physical, mental, and cognitive ability, or LGBTQA+ status to join our lab.

## Apply

While we are based at [Loyola University Chicago](https://www.luc.edu/), and we welcome anyone interested in using emerging technologies and software engineering to solve problems.

To learn more about how to apply, see our [Apply](/apply/) page.

## Website Issues

See [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/LoyolaChicagoCS/ssl2) for the source code of this project or to report issues for this website. Current SSL members should use the issue tracker or pull requests to suggest content changes.
